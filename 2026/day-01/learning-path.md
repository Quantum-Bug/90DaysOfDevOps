## 🚀 The DevOps Blueprint: 90 Days to Mastery

### 👤 Profile & Perspective

* **Current Level:** Non-IT Background (Career Switcher)
* **My Understanding:** To me, DevOps isn’t just a toolset; it’s the bridge between writing code and delivering value. It’s about engineering systems that are scalable, resilient, and invisible to the end user.
* **The "Why":** I am starting this journey to build a future-proof career in tech, focusing on solving complex architectural challenges and driving efficiency in modern software delivery.

### 🎯 90-Day Mission Goals

1. **Build the Foundation:** Master Linux fundamentals and networking to bridge the gap from a non-IT background.
2. **Upskill for Impact:** Move beyond basic tool knowledge to master Terraform and Kubernetes, building a portfolio of complex, real-world projects that prove my technical depth.
3. **Career Transition:** Transform my profile into a "Job-Ready" DevOps Engineer by documenting my journey, earning relevant certifications, and actively applying for roles to land my first break in the industry.

### 🛠️ Core Skill Focus

* **Terraform:** Treating infrastructure with the same rigor as application code to ensure repeatable, version-controlled environments.
* **Kubernetes Debugging:** Developing the "detective" skills needed to troubleshoot pod failures, networking issues, and resource constraints.
* **Container Orchestration:** Mastering the logic of how containers communicate, scale, and heal within a cluster.

### ⏳ Execution Strategy

Consistency is my primary metric for success. I will treat my learning like a production system: **zero downtime.**

* **Weekly Time Budget:** ~22 Hours
* **Weekdays:** 2.5 hours (Focus: Hands-on labs and theory)
* **Weekends:** 4-5 hours (Focus: Deep-dive projects and documentation)


* **Consistency Hack:** I will follow the "one-commit-a-day" rule. Even on busy days, I will contribute at least one script or configuration to my GitHub to maintain momentum.

### 🏁 The Destination

By the end of these 90 days, I want to transition from "learning about tools" to **"engineering solutions."** My goal is to be a technically proficient DevOps candidate who can talk through the "how" and "why" of cloud infrastructure with confidence.
